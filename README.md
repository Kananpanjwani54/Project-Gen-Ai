# Project-Gen-Ai
This is the gen Ai project given by the trainer to us for our summer internship.
Based on your Python script `copy_of_image_to_storygenerator.py`, here’s a professional `README.md` you can use:

🖼️ Image to Story Generator

This project transforms any uploaded image into a short, AI-generated story using state-of-the-art deep learning models. It combines image captioning with creative text generation to bring your visuals to life with imaginative narratives.

 🌟 Features

- 📸 Converts images into descriptive captions using the BLIP model.
- ✍️ Generates short stories from those captions using GPT-2.
- 🌐 User-friendly web interface powered by Gradio.

🚀 Demo

Upload an image and get a caption along with a story generated by AI!

## ✨ Example Output

Input: 🖼️ Picture of a boy flying a kite
Caption: A young boy is flying a colorful kite in the sky.
Generated Story:

> A young boy named Aryan stood in the open field, his eyes gleaming with excitement as the wind tugged at his vibrant kite...

 🔮 Future Improvements

* Add support for multilingual story generation.
* Improve the story coherence using larger models (like GPT-3.5 or GPT-4).
* Allow downloading the generated story as a PDF or image.
